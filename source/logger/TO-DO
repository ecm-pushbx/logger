To-Do for initial release:

* Interface, Log viewing
* Driver, Advanced logging method
* Both, UMB memory support for LOG
* Both, LOW memory support for LOG

Maybe do in later releases:

* Driver HOT-KEY support
* Driver HOT-KEY screen captures
* Interface HOT-KEY assignment

Just under consideration and might do. It would increase the size of device
driver. So, might not.

* Remove direct to log writing from Interface by adding a "write to log"
* Remove direct reading of log in Interface program by adding a "read from log"
* Remove direct clearing of log by Interface program with a "clear from log"
* Add DOS support for reading and writing to LOG character device.
