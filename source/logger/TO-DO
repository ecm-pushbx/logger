To-Do for initial release:

* Driver, Advanced logging method
* UMB memory support for LOG
* LOW memory support for LOG

Maybe do in later releases. They would increase the size of device driver. So,
might not. We will see.

* Driver HOT-KEY support
* Driver HOT-KEY screen captures
* Interface HOT-KEY assignment
* Viewer, jump to end instead of paging down to reach end.

Just under consideration. These would also increase the size of the device
driver. But, they would probably not provide much benefit to actual usage.

* Remove direct to log writing from Interface by adding a "write to log"
* Remove direct reading of log in Interface program by adding a "read from log"
* Remove direct clearing of log by Interface program with a "clear the log"
* Add DOS support for reading and writing to LOG character device.
