Developer demo files for interacting with the Logger device driver.

LOG-CLR		- Turn off logging and clear the log.
LOG-OFF		- Simply turn off logging.
LOG-ON		- Simply turn on logging.
LOG-STAT	- Display the current status of logging.
LOG-MSG		- Send a message to the log. Using Red text if color is enabled.

Of course, the driver needs to be loaded. However, it does not need to be
enabled (actively logging) for these to function.
