To-Do for initial release:

* Driver, the more advanced logging method flush lines
* Driver, when loaded low, support Logging to low memory

Maybe stuff that could be in later releases that should not increase the device
driver's memory footprint.

* Viewer, jump to end instead of paging down to reach end.
* HTML format log output.
* Export log or selection from viewer to file (TEXT, ANSI, HTML).
* Resize LOG capacity.
* Force simple capture mode even when Advanced Capture is supported.
* Enable/Disable Log JAM mode.
* Single EXE instead of SYS+COM files.

Maybe do in later releases. They would increase the size of device driver. So,
might not. We will see.

* Interface, assign color to items manually logged using STDIN and MESSAGE.
* Driver, HOT-KEY support
* Driver, HOT-KEY screen captures
* Driver, HOT-KEYs to enable/disable logging
* Interface, Change HOT-KEY assignments
* Switch between COLOR and MONOCHROME logging.
* Hook an interrupt (somewhere) to provide a direct interface to driver. This
would permit other programs (including the log interface program) to easily
test if it is installed. Also it would provide status information and a simple
way to read and write messages in the log.

Just under consideration. These would also increase the size of the device
driver. But, they would probably not provide much benefit to actual usage.

* Remove direct to log writing from Interface by adding a "write to log"
* Remove direct reading of log in Interface program by adding a "read from log"
* Remove direct clearing of log by Interface program with a "clear the log"
* Add DOS support for reading and writing to LOG character device.
