                   general boot message logging system

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Logger consists of a pair of programs that use various methods to capture text
during the system boot process. The first is LOGGER.SYS which is a device
driver that gets loaded by the system config file. The second part is an
interface program called LOGGER.COM which can communicate with the device
driver.

*******************************************************************************

LOGGER.SYS [XMS | UMB | LOW] [COLOR | MONO] [JAM] [size]

	XMS	Use XMS for log data storage. (default)
	UMB	Use upper memory for log storage.
	LOW	Use lower memory for log storage.

	COLOR	Record color attributes associated with log text. (default XMS)
	MONO	Only record log text. (default for UMB and LOW)

	JAM	Stop recording if log is full. Normally when if the buffer
		becomes full, older messages are discarded to make room.

	size	Amount of memory to allocate for log in kilobytes.
		(default for XMS is 256, UMB is 32 and LOW is 16 kilobytes)

EXAMPLES:

DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\LOGGER.SYS
DEVICEHIGH=C:\DOS\LOGGER.SYS UMB COLOR JAM 16
DEVICE=C:\DOS\LOGGER.SYS LOW 8

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LOGGER.COM [ ON ] [ PRINT | ANSI | VIEW | CLEAR | MSG text ]

	ON		Turns logging back on.
	PRINT		Outputs the log text to STDOUT.
	ANSI		Outputs the log text (with color) to STDOUT.
	VIEW		View the log.
	CLEAR		Empties the current log.
	MSG text	Add message text to the log.
	STDIN		Add text from STDIN to the log.

Anytime LOGGER.COM is executed, it turns off message logging. It does not
turn the message logging back on unless the /ON option is provided. The
exception to that is when LOGGER.COM adds messages to the log manually with
either the MSG or STDIN options. Those options return logging to its previous
OFF or ON state.
